# IoT Based System for Safety and Health Monitoring of Industrial Workers

- Internet of Things acts as a gateway for various smart things as well as in the field of cloud networking servers. A hybrid wearable sensor network system towards the Internet of Things (IoT) connected safety and health monitoring applications is resented. The system is aimed at improving safety in the outdoor workplace. The proposed system consists of a wearable body area network (WBAN) to collect user data and a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) to connect the WBAN with the Internet. 

- The wearable sensors in the WBAN are exerted to measure the environmental conditions around the subject using a Safe Node and monitor the vital signs of the subject using a Health Node. A standalone local server (gateway), which can process the raw sensor signals, display the environmental and physiological data, and trigger an alert if any emergency circumstance is detected, is designed within the proposed network. To connect the gateway with the Internet, an IoT cloud server is implemented to provide more functionalities, such as web monitoring and mobile applications.
